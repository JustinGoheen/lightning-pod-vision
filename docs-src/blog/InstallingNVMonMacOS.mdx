The following is a simple flow for installing [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/en/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) on macOS.

## Step Zero

You will need [homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed. If you do not have homebrew installed, you can do so with the following:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## First Step

install NVM with homebrew.

```bash
brew install nvm
# update .zshrc or .bashrc
vim .zshrc
```

## Second Step

add the following to your .zshrc or .bashrc profile:

```bash
export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh
```

## Third Step

restart your terminal, and check the nvm version with:

```bash
nvm -v
```

:::tip
to exit insert mode, hit: `esc` + `shift` + `:wq!`

## Fourth Step

install node, and enable yarn

```bash
nvm install lts
corepack enable
```

## Fifth Step

install TypeScript globally for user

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
